Q: WTF is it?
A: A bash sys-admin framework for standardising scripting.

REQUIREMENTS
============

You need bash v4.0+

You need gnu grep v2.0+ (probably)

You need the following perl modules for the VMware stuff to work:
    - TODO

INSTALLATION & SETUP
====================

Install from the git repository:

    export PROFILE=DEC
    make

This will installs everything required monolithically under `~/.site/' - and
that is mostly just symbolic links pointing back to the git area, and one
`extern' directory for any 3rd party requirements.  The installer will pull
all such 3rd party software down into this folder and set up links as necessary.

Next, configure it for your site:

    cp share/siterc.example ~/.siterc
    vim ~/.siterc

Specially for Mac OS X users, you will want to install the gnu utilities via
brew, install sed, awk, and grep, and uncomment and configure the function
declarations in this file to point to the gnu utilities, not the Mac OS X
BSD versions.

Bash is also too old on Mac OS X, so make sure to override it too by uncommenting
and configuring SITE_SHELL.
